  <p>SKARLET by Aaron Dela Cruz 2022 <br><br>
      I really enjoy art especially pixel art and I enjoy timelapse of how art was created. If youknow reddit, you have probably heard about r/place, which is a canvas where multiple reddit users can place one pixel at a time. <br><br> This casued many communites to created amazing art and at the end of the project, there is a timelapse you can go over.<br><br>
      This is what inspired me to make these works.
